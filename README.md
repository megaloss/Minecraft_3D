# Minecraft_3D
Having fun using Minecraft as a sandbox for 3D printing

Using this code you could recreate a model from stl file in Minecraft.
I use Spigot ant RaspberryJuice mod to connect with mcpi library for Python.
Setting dry_run=False lets first look at the model after processing it before really building it in Minecraft.
