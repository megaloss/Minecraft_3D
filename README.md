## Having fun using Minecraft as a sandbox for 3D printing

  Using this code you could recreate a model from stl file in Minecraft.
I use Spigot ant RaspberryJuice mod to connect with mcpi library for Python.

Setting **dry_run=False** lets only see the model after processing it without really building it in Minecraft.
